## Introduction
reconciliationNSW is a unique Python script that utilises the Hansard API of the Australian State Parliament, to ultimately allow users to search for key terms within a certain 
range of years. The script provides an .xslx spreadsheet that records the existence of key terms, and if so, the number of key terms associated with it.

## Getting Started
To get started, clone the repository into your local machine.
Install Python if it has not been done so. 
Install libraries:
- openpyxl
- PyPDF2
- requests

To install a library, run the command into your windows terminal: `pip install [name of library]`

## Usage
Run the Python script in any software you have currently. The process will begin automatically.

## Changelog
Verion 1.0 -- Includes basic searches within predetermined years to search for key terms associated with reconcilliationNSW.
## Acknowledgement
- Thanks to the Parliament of NSW for providing the public API that provided the open access to the Harsard PDF documents.

## Future Updates
List of future updates to this application:
- customisable search terms
- narrower time ranges
- optimised performances
