## Introduction
reconciliationNSW is a unique Python script that utilises the Hansard API of the Australian State Parliament, to ultimately allow users to search for key terms within a certain 
range of years. The script provides an .xslx spreadsheet that records the existence of key terms, and if so, the number of key terms associated with it.

## Getting Started
To get started, download the whole repository (or alternatively just the dist folder) to get started. 

The source code is included for references. 

## Usage
Navigate to the /dist folder, double click on the .exe file. The software would run. Enter in the range of years, and the program will begin running. 

## Changelog
Version 1.2 -- Included custom search years. Optimised searching that reduces search time. 

Version 1.1.1 -- Fixed bug related to incorrect URL update which always resulted in querying the year 2016. Implemented recording of chambers. 

Version 1.1 -- Includes three new search terms, outputted into an Excel file. Bundled into a single .exe file. 

Verion 1.0 -- Includes basic searches within predetermined years to search for key terms associated with reconcilliationNSW.
## Acknowledgement
- Thanks to the Parliament of NSW for providing the public API that provided the open access to the Harsard PDF documents.

List of future updates to this application:
